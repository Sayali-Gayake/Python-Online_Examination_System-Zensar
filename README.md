# Online Examination System

## About Me
Hello! I am Sayali Ramprasad Gayake, a third-year *Computer Engineering* student at *AVCOE College*.

The **Online Examination System** is a RESTful API designed to manage online exams, students, results, and notifications efficiently. Developed entirely using Python's core libraries, this project ensures seamless interaction with a MySQL database for CRUD operations. The API has been thoroughly tested using Postman for functionality and reliability.

## Overview

This system simplifies the management of online examinations by enabling:
- **Student Management**: Add, view, and remove student records.
- **Exam Management**: Schedule exams and manage exam details.
- **Results Processing**: Record, update, and notify students about their performance.
- **Notifications**: Automatically notify students of grade updates via database triggers.

With a clean and modular structure, the API is lightweight and perfect for basic examination systems.

## Features

1. **Centralized Database**  
   A well-structured MySQL database with tables for Students, Exams, Questions, Results, and Notifications.

2. **Core Python Implementation**  
   The entire API is developed using Python’s standard libraries, ensuring minimal dependencies.

3. **CRUD Functionality**  
   Comprehensive operations to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records for each module.

4. **Automation**  
   MySQL triggers and procedures for grade generation and real-time notifications.

5. **Postman Tested**  
   All endpoints are tested for reliability and accuracy.
